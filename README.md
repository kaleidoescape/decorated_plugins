# decorated_plugins
A python3.7 demo implementing a mini-architecture for plugins, using decorators. 

The blog post describing this code is here: [https://kaleidoescape.github.io/decorated-plugins/](https://kaleidoescape.github.io/decorated-plugins/)

The example will take the sentences in `data/input.txt`, process them with some silly regexes, and create a new output in `data/input.txt.processed`. You can run it with:

```
python run.py
```
